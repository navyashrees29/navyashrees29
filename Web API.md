# Web API

The **ASP.NET Web API** is a framework provided by Microsoft for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a broad range of clients including browsers, mobiles and tablets, etc.

# HTML Helpers

- HTML Helpers are methods that return a string.

- Helper class can create HTML controls programmatically. HTML Helpers are used in View to render HTML content.

- We can build an ASP.NET MVC application without using them, but HTML Helpers helps in the rapid development of a view.

- HTML Helpers are more lightweight as compared to ASP.NET Web Form controls as they do not use ViewState and do not have event models.

- MVC has built-in Helpers methods

- We can create custom HTML helpers.
