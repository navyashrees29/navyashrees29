# Entity Framework

- Entity Framework is an open-source ORM framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft.
- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique of accessing a relational database.  
- An ORM takes care of creating database connections and executing commands, as well as taking query results and automatically materializing those results as your application objects.
- An ORM also helps to keep track of changes to those objects, and when instructed, it will also persist those changes back to the database.
