# Ajax 

AJAX = **A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML.

AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page.

AJAX allows you to send only important information to the server not the entire page. So only valuable data from the client side is routed to the server side. It makes your application interactive and faster.

AJAX just uses a combination of a browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server) and JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).
